- #### Start by implementing the models which we created in class Diagram
- #### Either take values via constructor or instantiate within the class


- Once done with models, now we need to start with features, but how will you start doing it?
- will you implement random feature or some sequence.

- Evaluation is based on important feature working and not on non-working features

- These classes
- Some from all the features need to be implemented
